# Yield Farmer

This project demonstrate yield farming using a custom governance token and one or more LP tokens

The Yield farming is oversimplified as follows:
- each pool receives 1 governance token rewarded per block
- rewards go from a specific block to a defined end block
- before the defined start block and after the end block, no rewards will be paid
